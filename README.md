# BISI_Project
Final Project BISI

**Context:**

  Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

  A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

**Objective:**

  Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.

**Diabetes.xlsx:** Contains the data required for the project.

**Project_Diabetes_Prediction-PreethiKolli_041085180.ipynb:** Consists all the steps involved in the Exploratory data analysis of Diabetes in the Pima tribe.

We trained the data using Random Forest and Logistic Regression models and decided which model performed better when comparing the two based upon accuracy.

**Steps to run the ipynb file:**
1. Upload the provided ipynb and the excel files in the Jupyter notebook.
2. Open ipynb file and run through them.
